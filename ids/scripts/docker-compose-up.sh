# Deliberately plain `docker compose up`, no --profile: vector
# (profiles: [elk]) is meant to stay opt-in here -- it always tries to
# connect out to VECTOR_HOST (vector/vector.yaml has no ELK_ENABLED gate
# of its own; that env var isn't referenced there at all), so blanket-
# starting it for everyone running this script would mean real outbound
# connection attempts nobody asked for. Use
# `docker compose --profile elk up` (or the dashboard's Services page)
# to include it. docker-purge.sh/docker-compose-down.sh, by contrast, DO
# use --profile '*' -- tearing down must always cover everything that
# might be running, regardless of which profile started it.
