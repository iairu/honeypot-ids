"""Transfers a project's .env content to/from its configured remote host
over SSH (core/ssh.py's option convention -- system ssh/scp binaries, so
the user's ssh_config/known_hosts apply exactly as from a terminal).

Two shapes, for two different UI flows:
  - upload_env(local_path, remote):    send an existing LOCAL FILE (scp) --
    used by the "Upload local .env to remote" button, which starts from a
    file already on disk.
  - download_env_text(remote) / upload_env_text(text, remote): fetch/send
    TEXT directly over an ssh pipe, no local file involved at any point --
    used by the wizard's remote-prefill env pages and the Settings page's
    Local/Remote toggle, where the content is fetched, edited in memory in
    the same EnvEditorWidget used for local files, and saved straight back
    to the remote host without ever touching local disk.

load_project_env() is the read-only convenience on top of both: "give me
this project's .env as an EnvFile, wherever it currently lives".
