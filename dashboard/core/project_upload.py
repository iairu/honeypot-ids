"""Syncs an entire project directory (not just .env) to its configured
remote host via rsync over SSH, so a fresh remote host actually has
everything needed to run `docker compose up` there -- core/env_upload.py's
upload_env() only sends the .env for a quick config-only push.

rsync (not scp -r) is deliberate: delta-transfer (a first sync moves
everything, a re-sync only moves what changed), native machine-readable
progress reporting (--info=progress2), and --exclude support so runtime/
log/backup data isn't blindly copied alongside actual project code -- see
EXCLUDE_PATTERNS, sized against this repo's real directory footprint
(confirmed live: ids/backups/ alone is 1.2GB, suricata_logs/
378MB -- neither belongs in a "deploy the project" sync).
