"""Kibana PDF export: one section per Kibana page button on the Kibana page
(ui/page_kibana._BOOKMARKS), each with a short explanation of what the page
shows and a full-page screenshot of it.

The screenshots themselves are captured by ui/kibana_export.KibanaCapture
(it needs a live, logged-in QWebEngineView); this module only turns the
captured images into the PDF, so it stays usable headlessly.

A full-page capture of a dashboard is usually far taller than one A4 page,
and QTextDocument never splits an image across pages -- so each capture is
sliced into page-sized strips here and laid out one after another.
